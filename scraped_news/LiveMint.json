    "content": "Late in 2023 Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, began peddling a new idea. Every country, he said, should have its own artificial-intelligence (AI) system, trained on domestic data, aligned with national values and built using local infrastructure. Appealing to policymakers’ fondness for manufacturing, the boss of the chip colossus described these systems as “AI factories”, ingesting data and churning out intelligence. He called it “sovereign AI”."

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said the US government doesn’t need to be concerned that the Chinese military will use his company’s products to improve their capabilities. LivemintUpdated14 Jul 2025, 09:59 AM ISTJensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, speaks during the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, June 11, 2025. (REUTERS)Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said the US government doesn’t need to be concerned that the Chinese military will use his company’s products to improve their capabilities.Addressing the largest concern Washington has cited in placing increasing restrictions on US technology exports to the Asian nation, Huang said the Chinese military will avoid using US technology because of the risks associated with doing so.Also Read | Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to hold media briefing in Beijing on July 16“We don’t have to worry about it,” he said in an interview on CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS broadcast Sunday.“They simply can’t rely on it,” he added. “It could be, of course, limited at any time.”Since 2022, the US government has imposed restrictions on the export of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China, citing concerns over potential military applications. The US also imposed a ban earlier this year on sales of Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chips to the country - which had been Nvidia's most powerful AI chip cleared for Chinese sales.Also Read | The week in charts: Brics disjointed, power demand down, Nvidia hits $4 trillionAlso Read | Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to hold media briefing in Beijing on July 16Huang and his peers have lost out on billions of dollars of revenue under increasingly tough rules designed to shut off China from access to the most powerful artificial intelligence capabilities. Successive administrations in Washington have maintained that unfettered use of the most capable components would pose a risk to national security.Nvidia’s CEO, who was in Washington last week before a trip to Beijing, has argued that the strategy will fail because it will spur growth of domestic capabilities in China that will eventually rival those created by the US technology industry.Also Read | How Nvidia became the world’s first $4 trillion companyNvidia and its peers say US companies should be allowed to ship to the world’s largest market for semiconductors to keep their products central to the development of AI.Huang met with President Donald Trump last week to make his case again and has praised the administration’s push to increase domestic production of semiconductors.Nvidia and others are dependent on the manufacturing facilities of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the majority of which are located on its home island, just off the Chinese mainland.Also Read | Jensen Huang adds $27.6 billion net worth in 2025 as Nvidia makes historyTrump touted the success of Nvidia and its growth to become the first US company to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization.
